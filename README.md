🔍 SQL Queries Used

## 1️⃣ Total Sales for May

SELECT ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS Total_Sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y')) = 5;

## 2️⃣ Total Orders in May

SELECT COUNT(transaction_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y')) = 5;

## 3️⃣ Month-over-Month Sales Comparison (April vs. May)

SELECT
    MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y')) AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS total_sales,
    (SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1)
    OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y'))))
    / LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1)
    OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y'))) * 100 AS mom_increase_percentage
FROM
    coffee_shop_sales
WHERE
    MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y')) IN (4, 5)
GROUP BY
    MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y'))
ORDER BY
    MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y'));

## 4️⃣ Sales Performance by Store Location

SELECT
    store_location,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) AS Total_Sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d/%m/%y')) = 5
GROUP BY store_location
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
